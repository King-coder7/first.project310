# Overview

As a software engineer, I'm building a personal portfolio to showcase my development skills and learning journey. This project marks the beginning of that portfolio.

This is a simple Hello World application that displays a personalized greeting message to the user. While basic in functionality, it demonstrates my ability to set up a development environment, write clean code, and document my work professionally.

I created this software to establish my GitHub presence, practice version control workflows, and create a foundation for more complex projects. It also serves as a starting point for learning software documentation and video demonstration skills.

# Development Environment

I used Visual Studio Code as my code editor with the Python extension for syntax highlighting and debugging support. Version control was managed through Git and GitHub Desktop.

The software is written in Python 3.12, a high-level interpreted programming language known for its readability and simplicity. No external libraries were required for this project.
